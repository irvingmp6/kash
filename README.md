<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
There are many great personal finance tools on the internet; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this little console app that I want to share with you. 

In addition to the application, I'll also be sharing a pre-built cashflow forecasting system to give you the power to make better and wiser financial decisions for you and your family.

Here's why:
* We're human. We do human things like accidentally spend the money that was meant for the electric bill. 
* Your time is precious. Everyone should budget but no one has the time to spend scroll through their bank statements or create complex formulas in an Excel spreadsheet.
* Unfortunately, a lot of personal finance tools fail to give you the day-to-day financial insights that really tell you where you stand.

This repository comes with all you need right out of the box. You just focus on the easy stuff.

Of course, no one product will serve everyone. Your needs may be different. So I'll be adding some more features in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

### Built With

The console app was developed using Python 3.12.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
* python 3.12 or higher
* Some basic SQL knowledge (to set up your custom queries)

### Installation
#### (Optional) Setting up a Python Virtual Environment
To avoid updating current packages on your current python set up, it's always good practice to isolate any new package dependencies with a virtual environment.

**Create** a new Python virtual environment. I'm calling mine `kashEnv`.
```
$ python -v venv kashEnv
```
**Activate** the virtual environment (for Windows users)
```
$ source kashEnv/Scripts/activate 
```
**Activate** the virtual environment (for MacOS or Linux users)
```
$ source kashEnv/bin/activate
```
#### Installing the package
**Download** the repository
```
$ git clone git@github.com:irvingmp6/kash.git
```
Once you have the code downloaded, you're ready to **install** Kash.
```
$ python -m pip install -e ./kash
```
